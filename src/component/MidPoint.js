                  <p className="boxh">Upsolving after a coding contest helps in analyzing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. It helps to identify gaps in understanding, reinforces coding concepts, and improves problem-solving skills. Additionally, it helps to build familiarity with common coding patterns and techniques and prepares for solving problems under time constraints in technical interviews. Solving problems after the contest also helps to identify the most efficient and effective solutions, allowing you to develop better problem-solving strategies. Overall, upsolving is an important aspect of continuous improvement and growth in competitive programming.
